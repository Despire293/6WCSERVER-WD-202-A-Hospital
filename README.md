Many in our days live in a generation where convenience is a must. Backthen, the
archives offices are being useful in retrieving datas to perform records of people and the data
really helps people to identify one another, the world has full of paper and the value of the
paper is what is written on it. People always wanted to take records in order to innovate or
reflect to the past and without any records people could not go forward or re-constructing the
past to build a better future. According to Team Luxa (2021), Keeping records is important to
prevent Flaudulent transactions and many factors could also be included such as to have
credentials for positive status etc.

Nowadays, technology is a trend. In-order to innovate, our business must also
innovate to survive. A change is a must to survive the environment, many people relies more
to technology because technology is invented to create convenience and efficiency of work, it
gives lesser time to retrieve, and compute on what is the needed operation. and we can tell
that it is faster and convenient. To add trust to patients we must have records on what job the
people in a medical staff are for security.
Combining records and technology with health relation, ‘A-Hospital’ is built in order
to give records of nurses or staff around the hospital, it takes time to retrieve datas, and
people does not have time to be validated because medical staff are busy saving lives.

emergency call-out to staff.
